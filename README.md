# Body Fat Calculator : Stat628_Module2

### Overview

- This module aims to develop a `R` code and a `Rshiny` application to predict the body fat percentage for MEN.

- This `shiny` app asks users to enter different measurements like `height`, `weight`, `abdomen` and `age`, calculates `body fat` percentage, and shows result and suggestions accordingly!

- [code](code) contains all of the raw code written in `R language` and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app code 

- [output](output) contains two page summary for the module

- [images](images) contains all of the plots and tables produced during analysis

### How to run this code?

- Before running this code you need to install R-Studio, R-CRAN and R packages like `car`, `MASS`, `carplot` and `ggplot2`

- Shiny code can be run in `Rstudio` similar to `R` script

- Install packages `shiny` and [shinythemes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinythemes/index.html) before running the script 

- Set `Stat628_Module2` as a working directory
- To run the r code use script [BodyFatCalculatorFinalCode](code/BodyFatCalculatorFinalCode)
- To run the shiny code use script [bodyfatshiny_FINALapp.R](code/bodyfatshiny_FINALapp.R)
